title: Ottoman Decolonization
---

For decades, historians argued about who was responsible for WWI, usually tending towards pinning responsibility on Germany to one or another degree (esp. the Fischer thesis). From our Black Sea angle, it is fascinating to see the war as a consequence of Ottoman decolonization â€“ the loss of the Balkans as a violent process. The readings focus on nationalism in the Balkans, and particularly the desire for a Greater Serbia, as a serious cause of war. In the older historiography, the "small nations" of the Balkans were not supposed to have agency, and were seen as "questions" or "problems" to be manipulated by the Great Powers. And yet: if Italy and Germany were able to form national states under the leadership of Piedmont-Sardinia and Prussia, respectively, why should not Serbia perform a similar function in southeastern Europe? The European powers did not like this idea.
