title: New Nations and Oil Pipelines
---

Some key themes after 1991, in the meantime:
– The issue of borders and nation formation. Something vital is that, in 1991, the "bloodless" collapse of the Soviet Union entailed leaving borders absolutely intact, even if they made no rational sense (e.g. Ukraine, where the borders were a "gift" from Khrushchev in 1954, on the 300th anniversary of the Treaty of Pereyaslav). But the bloodshed did follow (to put it mildly), e.g. in our region: Georgian-Russian war of August 2008, Crimea & Eastern Ukraine/Donbass (2014 & ongoing), Chechnya, Transnistria.
– Changing parameters of oil production and transport (including right now, thus updating Sharples)
– Changing ecologies in the Black Sea since the political transformations, e.g. fish stocks (has gotten a lot better)
– New frameworks of cooperation & conflict across the Black Sea, e.g. Russia/Turkey.
